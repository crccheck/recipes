## Notes
* filling will tend to bubble up the highest about 3cm from the rim.
* make sure to remove all air bubbles
* 350 deg-F gives some nice brownage
* add a ramekin filled with water to the oven
* Crack prevention tips:
  * Add a teaspoon of flour or corn starch to the mix
  * Don't cook in a water bath because it will get into your spring form pan.
    Instead, put the pan in a heavy saucepan/cast iron and then in the oven.
    This will slightly increase your baking time.
  * Do not over-bake. If it looks gooey, it'll be fine because you're going to
    serve it chilled. The raw ingredients are solid at room temp.
  * After baking and while still warm, run a knife around the edge so prevent
    cracking (about 20 minutes after)
  * While cooling, cover with a cookie sheet so it cools evenly


## Oreo Crust

My favorite crust is the Oreo crust. My favorite is when it's so thick you don't
need a plate.

+ about 10 oz Oreos (two rows)
- process lightly in a food processor until coarse
- preheat oven to 350-deg F
- put Oreo chunks into the bottom of a springform pan
- put in preheating oven for about 10 minutes for the cream to soften
- pull from oven and tamp down to form the crust

Tip: I use the leftover corner of parchment paper wrapped on a steel bottle
to tamp down the crust.
