## pastry dough (oil dough, water dough)
freeze to firm, make puff pastry (thirds, fourths, fourths)
 -- first roll (thirds), roll out the water dough. then smash the oil dough till
    it is about 60% the area of the water dough. tuck the corners of the water
    dough over the oil dough to form a packet and then fold into thirds.

on the final roll, liberally flour the bottom. when placing the discs into the
tart pan, make sure to put the flour side down. also use leftover crisco to
grease the bottom of the pan. also reserve the big chunks for the next batch of
pastry dough (throw them in during the first folding).
