# Dan Tat

The secret to my dough is that I don't clean my food processor bowl between the
oil dough and the water dough so that I can get a little fat into my water dough.
I also don't roll out my oil dough. It's mallable enough where I just squish it
into a sheet in the plastic, and then unwrap it into my rolled out water dough.

With my [tart tin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CQKDOWI/?tag=crtobu-20), I
find that I have to liberally grease it. Then dough releases very easily.

## oil dough
 + 150g ap flour (~1 C)
 + 1 stick (8T) butter (~111g)
 -- process until coarse
 + 1 stick (8T) shortening (~183g)
 -- process til shortening is incorporated

## water dough

 + 250g ap flour (~1.75C)
 + 25g sugar (~ 2 T)
 + 0.5 beaten egg
 + 3g shortening (re-use bowl and scrape to get the 3g shortening)
 -- pulse to combine
 + 75g cold water (probably a lot more because my place is so dry)
 -- process until dough just starts coming together. Err on the dry side.

## pastry dough (oil dough, water dough)
  - use wax paper to size and form the oil dough
  - freeze to firm, make puff pastry
  - roll out the water dough
  - put the oil dough on top then roll into thirds
  - then fourths
  - then fourths again
 
on the final roll, liberally flour the bottom. when placing the discs into the
tart pan, make sure to put the flour side down. Liberally buttering the bottom of the pan
will help the tarts release.

If you're making lots of batches, reserve the big chunks for the next batch of
puff pastry dough (throw them in during the first folding).


## egg filling
+ 80g sugar
+ 280 mL water
- make supersaturated solution and cool
  + 4 large eggs
  + 80 mL half and half
  - combine and sieve


## tart (pastry dough, egg filling)
 -- press disc into tart pan
 -- prick the bottom with a fork
 -- freeze for 5 minutes
 -- fill 4/5th with filling. DO NOT OVERFILL
 -- bake for 30 minutes at 350 F, middle or bottom rack
