## Pie Crust, double or weave

+ 390g (~3 C) AP flour
+ 224g (2 sticks) of frozen, cubed fat (butter, lard, shortening)
+ pinch of salt
+ pinch of sugar
-- process until butter is broken up (when adding fat, start with the harder fat [butter] then softer)
+ ~6 T ice water a little past cornmeal stage
-- divide roughly equally into balls for the top and bottom crust. Mine turned
   out to be 460g and 395g

Notes:

* This amount of crust will also make 6 mini pies, though not with top crusts. You'll have to get creative.
* As for the fat, I'm currently using half butter, half lard. Since lard doesn't come in sticks, I measure 112g to approximate 8T of lard.
* If you have too much fat, your dough will boil in oil as it bakes, making it tough. If you have too little oil, it will be dry and taste like a cracker. You have a lot of leeway though, you don't have to be that precise.
* You'll know you've added enough water when the dough will barely hold itself together when you pinch it. This takes experience.
* Don't over-process the butter. After you wrap it, you should see ~BB sized chunks of butter left. Controlling this will change how flaky your crust will turn out.
* Use commercial plastic wrap. It's > 50% wider than what you'll find in grocery stores (17" vs 12"). It will make turning out and wrapping dough a lot easier

## Apple Filling

By far, my favorite filling. My favorite apples to use in single-apple pies (in roughly favorite to least order):

* Pink Lady
* Gala
* Jonagold
* Granny Smith

When mixing apples, I *do* recommend throwing in some Granny Smiths because their tart flavor and firm texture
really mix together well with other apples.

+ 1 T lemon juice (at least, add more to taste) to a mixing bowl
+ many apples, peeled and sliced. toss them into the mixing bowl with the lemon juice to prevent browning (not that it really matters)
+ 1/4 C of sugar in a pan, start heating
+ 2 T butter to the pan
+ add the apples and lemon juice
* Cook on medium heat. As the apples lose water:
+ ~1 T flour. Add just enough flour to absorb the liquid
+ ~1 t cinnamon
+ dash nutmeg
+ additional sugar to taste
* Cook until it's slightly softened. It will continue to soften in the oven. You can also keep this for several days in the fridge. If you know you're going to refrigerate, you can compensate by cooking it a bit further on the stove.


## Cherry Filling, from frozen cherries
+ 3 packs of frozen cherries (3 * 1.75 cups)
+ 1/8 T almond extract


## Sweet Potato Filling

For a 9" pie [original source](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/sweet-potato-pie-i/)

+ 464g sweet potato
- microwave until soft
- scoop into a food processor
- process until smooth
+ 1 stick (8T) butter
+ 1 C sugar (to taste)
+ 1/2 C milk
+ 2 eggs
+ 1/2 t ground nutmeg (to taste)
+ 1/2 t ground cinnamon (to taste)
+ 1/3 t fresh grated ginger (to taste)
+ 1 t vanilla extract
-- mix until smooth

Notes: Make extra filling just to be safe. It freezes very well and also makes a great ice cream flavor.


## Free-Form Pear Gorgonzola
+ ~1.5 pears, sliced
+ ~1 T Gorgonzola cheese (to taste)
+ 2 T sugar (to taste)
+ 1 pie crust (single)
-- roll pie crust
-- sprinkle pears and cheese and sugar
-- curl edges of pie crust on top (no waste!)
-- bake at 375Â° F for about 45 minutes
