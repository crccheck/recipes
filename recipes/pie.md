## Pie Crust, double or weave
+ 2.25 C Flour
+ 2 sticks of frozen, cubed butter
+ pinch of salt
+ pinch of sugar
-- process until butter is broken up
+ ~6 T ice water a little past cornmeal stage
-- divide roughly equally into balls for the top and bottom crust. Mine turned
   out to be 460g and 395g

## Apple Filling

By far, my favorite filling. My favorite apples to use in single-apple pies (in roughly favorite to least order):

* Pink Lady
* Gala
* Jonagold
* Granny Smith

When mixing apples, I *do* recommend throwing in some Granny Smiths because their tart flavor and firm texture
really mix together well with other apples.

+ 1 T lemon juice (at least, add more to taste) to a mixing bowl
+ many apples, peeled and sliced. toss them into the mixing bowl with the lemon juice to prevent browning (not that it really matters)
+ 1/4 C of sugar in a pan, start heating
+ 2 T butter to the pan
+ add the apples and lemon juice
* Cook on medium heat. As the apples lose water:
+ ~1 T flour. Add just enough flour to absorb the liquid
+ ~1 t cinnamon
+ dash nutmeg
+ additional sugar to taste
* Cook until it's slightly softened. It will continue to soften in the oven. You can also keep this for several days in the fridge. If you know you're going to refrigerate, you can compensate by cooking it a bit further on the stove.
