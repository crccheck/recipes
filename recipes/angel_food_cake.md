# Angel Food Cake

Based on http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/angel-food-cake-recipe/index.html

Most recipes call for cream of tartar, but I'm pro. Can substitude lemon juice
too if you're going for a lemon angel food cake.

### Prep some superfine sugar
+ 1 3/4 C sugar
-- spin sugar in a food processor until it is superfine (about 2 minutes)
-- split into two batches (see below)

### Ingredients (dry)

America's Test Kitchen says to sift three times, but I'm lazy and only sift
twice total (once here, and one more sift as I fold it into the egg whites).

+ 1 C cake flour (loose), sifted
+ 1/4 t salt
+ 1 C superfine sugar

### Ingredients (wet)

I use a hand blender with a whisk attachment. If you're using a stand mixer,
beware of over-mising.

+ 12 egg whites (about 1.5 C, the closer to room temperature the better)
+ 1/4 C warm water
-- beat to medium peaks
+ 3/4 C superfine sugar
+ 1 t orange extract, or extract of your choice (+ 1.5 t lemon zest)
-- beat to stiff-ish peaks
-- fold in the dry ingredients

### Bake
Do not open the oven door while it's baking. That means don't turn it around
half-way through and don't try and bake two things at once.

  -- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  -- load pan with the cake batter
  -- smooth off the top
  -- bake for 35 minutes
  -- Cool upside down on cooling rack for at least an hour before removing from
     pan. For more air, balance on a glass bottle.
  -- Continue to let it dry out for at least another hour. Otherwise, the
     surface gets sticky and loses its yummy caramelized bits.
