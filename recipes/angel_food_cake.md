## Angel Food Cake

Based on http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/angel-food-cake-recipe/index.html
Most recipes call for cream of tartar, but I'm pro. Can substitude lemon juice too if you're going for a lemon angel food cake.

### Prep some superfine sugar
+ 1 3/4 C sugar
-- spin sugar in a food processor until it is superfine (about 2 minutes)

### Ingredients (dry)

+ 1 C cake flour, sifted
+ 1 C superfine sugar

### Ingredients (wet)
