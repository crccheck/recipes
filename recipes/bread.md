## Banana Bread, from America's Test Kitchen

To prep bananas, let them go black and then store them in the freezer for at least two weeks.
Or microwave on high for 5 minutes and then reduce the juice.

### dry ingredients
  + 1 3/4 C AP flour
  + 1/2 t salt
  + 1 t baking soda

### wet ingredients
  + 1 stick soft butter
  + 1 t vanilla extract
  + 2 eggs
  + 3/4 C brown sugar
  + 5 very ripened bananas

### banana bread
  * combine wet into dry ingredients, do not over-mix
  + 1/2 C toasted walnuts
  * load into in loaf pan
  + dust with sugar
  * 350 F for an hour, middle rack, rotate half-way through

Notes:
* mix will approximately double in volume
* yields 5 to 6 mini-loaves, bakes in about 20 minutes
* The top will start browning very quickly around 20 minutes. Pull it out too quick, and the top won't get a nice crust. But pull it out too soon, and the bread will get dry.

To experiment:
  * butter and dust loaf pan(s) with sugar
