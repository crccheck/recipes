## Banana Bread (based on America's Test Kitchen)

To prep bananas, let them go black and then store them in the freezer for at least two weeks. Let the bananas thaw and peel them into a 2 C measuring cup

### dry ingredients
  + 1 1/2 C AP flour (equal to the volume of bananas)
  + 1/2 t salt (less if topping with salt)
  + 1 t baking soda (at least)

### wet ingredients
  + 3/4 C dark brown sugar
  + 1/4 C oil
  + 1 t vanilla extract
  + 2 eggs
  + 5 very ripened bananas (1 1/2 C or 350g)
  + 1/2 stick soft butter

### banana bread
  * combine wet into dry ingredients, do not over-mix
  + (optional mixins)
  * load into in loaf pan
  + dust with sanding sugar and pinch of kosher salt
  * 350 F middle rack, rotate half-way through. Done when a tooth pick comes out clean.
    mini loaves will take about 20 minutes, full loaf will take about an hour.

### Optional mixins
  + 1/2 C toasted walnuts
  + 1/2 C toasted pecans
  + honey

Notes:
* mix will approximately double in volume
* yields 5 to 6 mini-loaves
* The top will start browning very quickly around 20 minutes. Pull it out too quick, and the top won't get a nice crust. But pull it out too soon, and the bread will get dry.

Tips:
* Top with banana slices, or salt/sugar

To experiment:
  * reduce the oil a bit so it's not quite so moist
  * move to top rack the last 10 minutes
  * butter and dust loaf pan(s) with sugar
