# Base Custard

## yolks

  + 2 egg yolks
  -- whip until pale yellow
  + 1/4 C sugar
  -- whip for an additional 10 seconds

## Custard (yolks)

  + 1 C whole milk
  -- bring up to warm temp
  + yolks
  -- temper in yolks (optional, can just throw them in since the dairy isn't that hot)
  -- continue raising temperature until thick (coats back of spoon)

  + 1/2 C heavy cream (this also brings down the temperature. If overrun is
    desired, whip the cream first).
  + add sugar to taste
  -- strain
  -- chill to freezing point
  -- churn


# Donut Ice Cream

Modify the [base custard] with:

  + 1.5 glazed donuts
  -- chopped to panko size
  + subtract sugar to taste

Add the donut after the the custard is made and strained. Adding it early will
make the resulting ice cream a little gummy. I guess some gluten can still
develop after baking.


# Cake Batter Ice Cream

Modifed [base custard] by not using less sugar and adding vanilla. Mix 1/3 C
yellow cake mix into the heavy whipping cream before combining it with the hot
custard. I don't add extra sugar because the flour will help keep ice crystals
from forming.


# Blood Orange Sorbet

Taken from my gelato maker's instruction manual.

  + 1 2/3 C orange juice (about 6 blood oranges)
  + 1/2 C heavy cream
  + 1/2 C sugar

mix and churn
