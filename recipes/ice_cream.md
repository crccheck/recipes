# Base Custard

## yolks

  + 2 egg yolks
  -- whip until pale yellow
  + 1/4 C sugar
  -- whip for an additional 10 seconds

## Custard (yolks)

  + 1 C whole milk
  -- bring up to warm temp
  + yolks
  -- temper in yolks (optional, can just throw them in since the dairy isn't that hot)
  -- continue raising temperature until thick (coats back of spoon)

  + 1/2 C heavy cream (this also brings down the temperature. If overrun is
    desired, whip the cream first).
  + add sugar to taste
  -- strain
  -- chill to freezing point
  -- churn


## Donut Ice Cream

Modify the [base custard] with:

  + 1.5 glazed donuts
  -- chopped to panko size
  + subtract sugar to taste

Add the donut after the the custard is made and strained. Adding it early will
make the resulting ice cream a little gummy. I guess some gluten can still
develop after baking.


## Green Tea Ice Cream

Green tea powder (or matcha if you're fancy) never really dissolves. So try to use as little as possible.
To counter, add extra egg yolks to bring up the richness.

  + 1 C whole milk
  + 4 yolks
  + 1/4 C sugar
  + 1/2 C heavy cream (this also brings down the temperature. If overrun is
    desired, whip the cream first).
  + add sugar to taste


## Blood Orange Sorbet

Taken from my gelato maker's instruction manual.

  + 1 2/3 C orange juice (about 6 blood oranges)
  + 1/2 C heavy cream
  + 1/2 C sugar

mix and churn
