# Base Custard

## yolks

  + 2 egg yolks
  -- whip until pale yellow
  + 1/4 C sugar
  -- whip for an additional 10 seconds

## Custard (yolks)

  + 1 C whole milk
  -- bring up to warm temp
  + yolks
  -- temper in yolks (optional, can just throw them in since the dairy isn't that hot)
  -- continue raising temperature until thick (coats back of spoon)

  + 1/2 C heavy cream (this also brings down the temperature. If overrun is
    desired, whip the cream first).
  + add sugar to taste
  -- strain
  -- chill to freezing point
  -- churn


# Donut Ice Cream

Modify the [base custard] with:

  + 1.5 glazed donuts
  -- chopped to panko size
  + subtract sugar to taste

Add the donut after the the custard is made and strained. Adding it early will
make the resulting ice cream a little gummy. I guess some gluten can still
develop after baking.


# Cake Batter Ice Cream

Modifed [base custard] by not using less sugar and adding vanilla. Mix 1/3 C
yellow cake mix into the heavy whipping cream before combining it with the hot
custard. I don't add extra sugar because the flour will help keep ice crystals
from forming.


## Sweet Potato Ice Cream

If you have extra pie filling, you can turn it into great ice cream! To counter the added
water content of the filling, swap the cream/milk ratio and add extra sugar. Remember to strain!

  + 1 C heavy cream
  + yolks
  + sweet potato pie filling
  + 1/2 C milk
  + add sugar to taste
  + add additional cinnamon/nutmeg/vanilla to taste

## Green Tea Ice Cream

Green tea powder (or matcha if you're fancy) never really dissolves. So try to use as little as possible.
A very rich base works better, so modify my base by flipping the milk/cream ratio and add at least one extra yolk.

  + 1 t green tea powder
  + my usual base, but with extra fat and extra yolks


## Blood Orange Sorbet

Taken from my gelato maker's instruction manual.

  + 1 2/3 C orange juice (about 6 blood oranges)
  + 1/2 C heavy cream
  + 1/2 C sugar

mix and churn


## Lemon Ice cream

Based on http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/07/lemon-ice-cream-with-candied-lemon-recipe.html

Make the custard:

  + 1 C heavy cream
  + 1/2 C half and half
  + 3 egg yolks
  + lemon zest
  + 3/8 C sugar

Let it cool. Then add the juice of 1 to 2 lemons prior to serving.


## Beer Ice Cream

Variation from base:

* Instead of 1C milk and 1/2C cream, use 1C cream and 1C of beer reduced to 1/2C
* Reduce the amount of sugar because alcohol will keep the texture smooth
