## Base Custard
  + 2+ egg yolks
  - whip until pale yellow
  + 85 g sugar (this is the minimum amount of sugar before this recipe gets icy)
  - whip again

  + 1 C whole milk
  - bring up to warm temp
  + add yolks
  - continue raising temperature until thick (coats back of spoon)

  + 1/2 C heavy cream (this also brings down the temperature. If overrun is
    desired, whip the cream first).
  + 90g sugar + additional to taste
  - strain
  - chill to freezing point
  - churn

**Notes:**

  * The more yolks, the richer the ice cream will taste
  * If using ultra pasteurized cream, use as little as possible for best flavor


# Donut Ice Cream

Modify the [base custard] with:

  + 1.5 glazed donuts
  - freeze the donuts
  - slice them into ~ 0.5cm slices
  - process in a food processor until panko sized flakes
  + subtract sugar to taste

You can keep these donut crumbs in the freezer for months.

Add the donut after the the custard is made and strained. Adding it early will
make the resulting ice cream a little gummy. I guess some gluten can still
develop after baking.


# Cake Batter Ice Cream

Modifed [base custard] by not using less sugar and adding vanilla. Mix 1/3 C
yellow cake mix into the heavy whipping cream before combining it with the hot
custard. I don't add extra sugar because the flour will help keep ice crystals
from forming.


## Sweet Potato Ice Cream

If you have extra pie filling, you can turn it into great ice cream! To counter the added
water content of the filling, swap the cream/milk ratio and add extra sugar. Remember to strain!

  + 1 C heavy cream
  + yolks
  + sweet potato pie filling
  + 1/2 C milk
  + add sugar to taste
  + add additional cinnamon/nutmeg/vanilla to taste

## Green Tea Ice Cream

Green tea powder (or matcha if you're fancy) never really dissolves. So try to use as little as possible.
A very rich base works better, so modify my base by flipping the milk/cream ratio and add at least one extra yolk.

  + 1 t green tea powder
  + my usual base, but with extra fat and extra yolks

## Strawberry Ice Cream

  - Make the regular base, but up the cream to at least half (half and half).
  - Let it chill
  + add about half a cup of chopped strawberries
  - process with a stick blender
  - strain and then freeze

## Blood Orange Sorbet

Taken from my gelato maker's instruction manual.

  + 1 2/3 C orange juice (about 6 blood oranges)
  + 1/2 C heavy cream
  + 1/2 C sugar

mix and churn


## Lemon Ice cream

Based on http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/07/lemon-ice-cream-with-candied-lemon-recipe.html

Make the custard:

  + 1 C heavy cream
  + 1/2 C half and half
  + lemon zest
  + 3 egg yolks
  + 3/8 C sugar
  - let it cool
  + juice of 1 to 2 lemons
  - mix

## Beer Ice Cream

References:

* http://www.americastestkitchenfeed.com/do-it-yourself/2012/08/homemade-beer-ice-cream/

Variation from base:

* Instead of 1C milk and 1/2C cream, use 1C cream and 1C of beer reduced to 1/2C
* Reduce the amount of sugar because alcohol will keep the texture smooth


## Sugar research

Ice cream hardness vs amount of sugar for basic vanilla base:

| grams | result |
|-------|--------|
| 75    | hard, but scoopable with a good scooper |
| 100   | soft, maybe too soft |
