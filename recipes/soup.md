# Gumbo

Simple gumbo w/ ordinary ingredients. I used to make my own spice blend, but over time, I focused more on having the chicken stock base. The base ingredients have too much salt so don't add more.

Start by making the roux over medium-low heat in cast iron. You'll need 

## roux
+ 1/2 stick of butter
+ 1/2 C of flour + additional as needed
- heat on the stove or in the oven
- stir until peanut butter color and consistency
- transfer roux for storage

## Sautee vegetables
+ 1 onion
+ 2 bell peppers
+ 6 ribs celery
+ 1 head garlic, peeled whole
- add 64 oz chicken stock, the best you can get. Homemade if possible.

## add spices and season to taste

I don't cook enough to justify buying the dozen individual spices so I rely on blends that are easy to stock. Add spices in phases

+ Tony Chachere's
+ 1 T fish sauce

## Meat

+ chicken thighs
- Transfer as much of the roux out as you can
- Cut into bite sized chunks
- Sear the chicken thighs in the remaining roux residue
- Transfer to gumbo
- Crisp sausage

- Simmer for an hour

When it's just about ready:

- mix in roux
+ sausage
+ 1 jalapeno, sliced

Serve over rice and garnish with green onion
