## Simple syrup

100 mL of water will take about 211 g of sucrose (2:1 sugar to water). Most simple syrup recipes use a 1:1 ratio by volume (5:6 by weight).
I like mine as concentrated as possible without waiting a long time for it to dissolve, so I aim for a 3:2 ratio by weight

  + 100 g boiling water
  + 150 g sugar


## Tapioca

  + 67g tapioca starch
  + 1/4 C boiling water
