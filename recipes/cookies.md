# Cookies

## Snickerdoodles

### Wet

+ 1 C (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter
- beat until soft
+ 1/2 t salt
+ 260g sugar
+ 2 eggs
+ 1 t vanilla extract
- beat until fluffy

### Dry

This can be prepped in advance. I found that a Talenti container is the perfect
size.

+ 460g AP flour
+ 2 t baking soda
+ 2 t cream of tartar

- Combine dry into wet
- wrap and chill for 30m

- preheat oven to 375-F
- make balls. Work quickly so the butter stays chilled.
- roll in ~2T cinnamon/sugar mix
- bake 8 minutes

Things to experiment with:
- less sugar

## Linh Choc Chip

200 gr of dark brown sugar
2 sticks of unsalted butter
1 egg
1/2 tps of salt
1/2 tps of baking soda
3 tbsp of vanilla extract (yah I use a lot)
3 tbsp of buttermilk (optional)
10 gr of chocolate powder (optional)
2 cups of flour
chocolate chips as desired

Directions:
Cream the butter, sugar, and eggs first. Really, really cream it.
Once creamed to a very smooth consistency, add everything else except flour and chocolate chips
Once consistency is good, add flour and chocolate chips. Do not over mix this part.
Optionally, put cookie dough in freezer for five minutes before baking. I haven't really noticed a difference, only in baking time. But my friend swears by it.

Bake at 325 for 12 minutes (depending on your oven)
