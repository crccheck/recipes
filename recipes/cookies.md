# Cookies

## Snickerdoodles

### Wet

+ 1 C (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter
- beat until soft
+ 1/2 t salt
+ 260g sugar
+ 2 eggs
+ 1 t vanilla extract
- beat until fluffy

### Dry

This can be prepped in advance. I found that a Talenti container is the perfect
size.

+ 460g AP flour
+ 2 t baking soda
+ 2 t cream of tartar

- Combine dry into wet
- wrap and chill for 30m

- preheat oven to 375-F
- make balls. Work quickly so the butter stays chilled.
- roll in ~2T cinnamon/sugar mix
- bake 8 minutes

Things to experiment with:
- less sugar
