Alton Brown's [Sweet or Savory Pate a Choux](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/sweet-or-savory-pate-a-choux-recipe.html)

You can throw the rest of the stick of butter in the custard.

+ 1 C water
+ 6 T butter (3/4 stick)
+ 1 T sugar
+ 1/8 t salt
- bring to a boil
- take pan off the heat
+ 160 g of AP flour
- stir with a wooden spoon until it forms a ball and there's a film on the
  bottom of the pan. You can use a nonstick pan, but you're going to have to
  guess.
- let cool for 15 minutes
+ 1 C eggs (about 4 large eggs and 1 white)
- mix eggs into dough little by little
- transfer to pastry bags (it takes 2 of my bags)
- pip into golfball sized turds
- with a wet finger, smooth out protrusions (they'll burn)
- stick into preheated 425-deg F oven for 10 minutes
- turn oven down to 350-def F
- back until golden brown, about 15 minutes
