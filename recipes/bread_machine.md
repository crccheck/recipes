## Basic white bread

From the manual:

  + 177g (3/4 C) water
  + 1 T butter
  + 15g (1.5 T) sugar
  + 1/2 t salt
  + 328g (2C + 2T) Bread flour
  + 7g (1T) dry milk
  + 1 t active dry yeast
  - QUICK rise
  - MEDIUM crust

## Basic white bread (starter)

If I make bread more often, I don't want to be dependent on store yeast. Let's try maintaining a starter and using that instead.
Combining the 1:2:3 starter:water:flour ratio (from https://cnz.to/tips-tricks/converting-yeast-based-recipes-to-use-a-sourdough-starter/) with the _Basic white bread_ recipe.
Hopefully this works

  + 168g water
  + 1/2 t salt
  + 15g (1.5 T) sugar
  + 7g (1T) dry milk
  + 253g bread flour
  - Form a well in the middle
  + 87g starter (100g was too much)
  - BASIC rise
  - MEDIUM crust
  
For next time: reduce water by a few grams
